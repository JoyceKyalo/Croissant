      Croissants are the most celebrated pastries renowned all over the globe.
      These yeasted viennoiseries are enriched with sugar and butter. There’s no
      match for the laminated flaky texture, fat-coated dough and folded layers
      of a traditional croissant recipe. These recipes may drastically vary
      along with environmental and cultural factors so there are naturally many
      croissant variants. Not every recipe or bakery is created equal and we
      know that it’s of the utmost importance for croissant aficionados to know
      which one’s the best, no matter where they are in the world. Here are the
      best croissants that you can find in the world.
